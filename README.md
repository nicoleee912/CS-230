1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a client that sought to develop a web-based version of their existing Android game, Draw It or Lose It. This game involves teams competing to
guess images being drawn within a time limit. The client’s primary requirement was to make the game accessible across multiple platforms, including MacOS, Linux, and Windows, while ensuring the game could support multiple teams and players, maintain unique identifiers, and handle web-based interactions effectively.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

One aspect I excelled at in developing this documentation was the thorough evaluation of different operating platforms, which allowed me to make well-informed 
recommendations tailored to the client’s needs. This included a clear assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of Linux, MacOS, Windows, and mobile devices as
hosting platforms.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document process was particularly helpful in structuring my approach to the actual coding phase. It allowed me to outline the necessary
system architecture, identify potential challenges early on, and ensure that all client requirements were addressed comprehensively.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the initial architecture design. I would enhance it by providing more detailed diagrams and a deeper exploration
of alternative architectural solutions. This would improve clarity and ensure that the design can scale efficiently as the project grows.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I carefully interpreted the client’s needs by focusing on cross-platform compatibility, unique identifiers, and scalable storage solutions. Understanding and
implementing the user’s needs is critical because it ensures that the final product aligns with their expectations and functions effectively in real-world
scenarios.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My approach to software design involved detailed evaluations of various platforms and a focus on creating a flexible, secure, and scalable solution. In the future,
I would continue to use comprehensive platform evaluations and include more user feedback in the early stages to refine the design further. Additionally, I would
utilize iterative development to ensure continuous improvement and alignment with user requirements.
